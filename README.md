You guys can download the Postman from here: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

When you download the Postman, you will see the login screen. After you logged in, choose GET in the interface and paste 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/' into the space next to GET.

We have only 3 methods: get_chain, mine_block, is_valid. I add their description under to them.

When you run your program, enter the Postman, and write methods next to URL. e.g. 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_chain'
